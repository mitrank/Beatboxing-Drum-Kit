# Beatboxing-Drum-Kit
This project uses ANN to create the model and feature extraction process using MFCC to learn about the audio information.
You can definitely play around with 'dense' value and epoch values to (maybe) get a better result :)
Just make sure you have Python 3.10.9 version installeed and following libraries installed:
1. NumPy
2. MatplotLib
3. Pandas
4. Tensorflow
5. Librosa
Rest other libraries mentioned in the main.py file will be automatically installed.

## For making it work with Google Colab-
Make sure to add 'tensorflow' before 'keras' in the libraries.
Eg: tensorflow.keras.utils instead of keras.utils
